# Playing GridWorld game using Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a GridWorld Environment where an agent learns to navigate from a starting position to a goal while avoiding obstacles using the Q-Learning algorithm. The implementation includes dynamic visualization to demonstrate the agent's learning process and decisions during each episode.
